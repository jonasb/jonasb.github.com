title: Tooling â€” Crashlytics
---

[Crashlytics](http://try.crashlytics.com/) is a service to collect crash reports for Android and iOS apps. They recently launched [Crashlytics for Android Stuido](http://www.crashlytics.com/blog/launching-crashlytics-for-android-studio/) so I gave it a go.

The installation is very smooth, the feature set seems complete enough (ProGuard support with automatic mapping upload, crash grouping etc), and the support is impressively responsive. With the Gradle plugin, once you have it set up everything is automatic after the initial set up. Crashlytics is a free service, courtesy or Twitter.

I haven't used Crashlytics that extensively yet, but I'm liking it so far.
