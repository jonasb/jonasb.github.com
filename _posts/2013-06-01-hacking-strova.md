title: Hacking — Ströva
---

I just came home from a hackathon, [Meet 'n' hack](http://mediaevolution.se/meetnhack/), here in Malmö that was aimed at local tourism. I arrived late and missed all the presentations during the Friday, and everyone were already teamed up, so I created my own little prototype. I've been thinking about the project for a while, I want to create a widelife app, collecting all information about nature reserves, country walks, hiking etc.

In the spirit of release early, the prototype, [Ströva, is now up on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wigwamlabs.strova). It's an Android app that shows nature trails in some twentyish areas of Skåne. It's very bare bones, but for the seven hours I managed to squeeze in, I'm quite happy with it. And it was awesome to see what all the other teams had produced.

I had great fun building it and I hope to get a chance to develop it further.
